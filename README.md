# Image generation in C#

This program allows you to generate images using a function for the individual pixels. Tinkering with it and changing it proved to be a lot of fun and I thought I'd share it here!

Remember that this project is for fun and will most likely not be maintained.

## Generate images
Running this program requires you to either have the .NET runtime installed or downloaded one of the release zip files sutable for your architecture.

To genereate an image just execute 
```sh
dotnet run
```
Have fun!
