# Image generation in C#

This program allows you to generate images using a function for the individual pixels. Tinkering with it and changing it proved to be a lot of fun and I thought I'd share it here!

Remember that this project is for fun and will most likely not be maintained.

## Generate images
As this program is meant to be rapidly changed and re-run, it requires you to have the .NET runtime installed.

To genereate an image just execute 
```sh
dotnet run
```
Have fun!
